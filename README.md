# TaskwarriorHolidaysGcalendar

Get Holidays for Taskwarrior calendar report from google calendar
The url used is `https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/es.bo%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics`, but you can use your country calendar by changing the part that is `es.bo` to for example `es.co` (for colombian holiday calendar)
You have to pipe the output to a file like `python3 getTwHolidaysGcal.py > holidays.es-BO.rc` and save it to your path of taskwarrior's calendar (/usr/share/doc/task/rc)

There are many TODO's, so this repo will be in constant improvement (I hope XD)
